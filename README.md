# Mean Shift and Segmentation Network

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning application for feature extraction and matching in images using Harris corner detection. It leverages the power of machine learning to identify key features in images, simplifies these images through transformations, and then employs detection and matching techniques to find similarities across different images.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Harris corner detection for feature extraction.
- Employs machine learning techniques to identify significant features in images.
- Simplifies images through transformations for more efficient processing.
- Detects and matches similar features across various images.

## Technical Details
- The project implements feature extraction and matching algorithms using Python.
- OpenCV library is used for image processing tasks.
